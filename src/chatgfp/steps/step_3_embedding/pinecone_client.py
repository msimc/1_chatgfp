Created: 2024-11-03 15:45 UTC
Version: 1.0.0

Summary:
--------
Provides integration with Pinecone vector database for the ChatGFP application.
This client handles vector similarity search and retrieval of FCA Handbook content
that has been previously embedded and stored in Pinecone.

Purpose:
--------
- Manages connection to Pinecone vector database
- Performs vector similarity search for relevant FCA handbook content
- Handles result processing and context aggregation
- Provides health monitoring and logging capabilities

Dependencies:
------------
- pinecone-client
- tenacity
- numpy

Environment Variables Required:
-----------------------------
- PINECONE_API_KEY
- PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT
- PINECONE_INDEX_NAME

Version History:

File Location and Purpose:
-------------------------
This file should be placed in:
src/chatgfp/steps/step_3_embedding/pinecone_client.py

This module serves as the interface between the ChatGFP application and the 
Pinecone vector database containing pre-embedded FCA Handbook content.

Next Steps:
----------
1. Implement unit tests in: tests/step_3_embedding/test_pinecone_client.py
2. Add integration tests for Pinecone connection
3. Implement query processing component
4. Add monitoring and alerting for Pinecone health checks
