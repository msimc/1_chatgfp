# FCA Data Preparation Project Summary

**Completed Components:**

1. Series A1 (Data Extraction & Categorization):

- A1a_categorizer.py: Initial setup and validation
- A1b_categorizer.py: HTML parsing and LEGAL-BERT keyword extraction
- A1c_categorizer.py: Keyword integration into HTML files
- A1d_categorizer.py: Professional category metadata addition

1. Series A2 (Vector Database Integration):

- A2a_chunking.py: Content chunking with metadata preservation
- A2b_insertion.py: Vector creation and Pinecone upload
- A2c_testing.py: Batch processing verification
- A2d_reset_and_prepare.py: Index management
- A2e_retrieve_inspect_pinecone.py: Quality verification

**Final Data Quality:**

- 114,274 vectors in Pinecone
- 768-dimensional LEGAL-BERT embeddings
- Consistent vector quality (mean: 9.60, std: 0.19)
- Complete metadata structure
- Well-organized regulatory content

**Ready for RAG with:**

- Reliable vector search capabilities
- Rich metadata for context
- Clear regulatory hierarchies
- Structured content organization
- Quality metrics for monitoring

The project has successfully prepared high-quality FCA regulatory data, optimized for RAG implementation. We can now move to a new chat to begin the RAG WebApp development.
